        <h2>Background :</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                I'm originally from Greenville NC, but my heart resides in New Orleans.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm also a fulltime single father with a 10-year-old daughter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Before going back to school. I was a tradesman, working mainly as a Pipefitter, Commercial Diver, and lastly a Tanker Driver. All of which I enjoyed dearly, but doing such
                work required constant travel, equating to time away from my little girl. I've had custody of my daughter since she was 2 years old and after losing most of our support system (my grandparents). 
                I made the decision to change careers for a trade/skill that requires less travel and more freedom. Ultimately to give me the ability to spend much more time raising my daughter 
                and pursuing my true career aspirations, Entrepreneurship and Technology.
            </li>
            <li>
                My newfound love is using software to build things such as websites and applications that serve the masses. 
                I'm always teaching myself to code with different languages and Stacks. Overall, the primary languages I have the most experience in are Swift for Mobile Development, 
                Python for Backend Development, and HTML5/CSS for Frontend Development. Java, JavaScript, and Node.js are the current new languages that I'm studying. 
                I generally pick up new languages and/or Tech. Stacks as needed for my personal projects and classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                I aspire to join the M.S. Data Science program at UNCC after obtaining a Bachelor of Software Engineering from ECU.
            </li>
            
        </ul>
